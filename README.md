The CLI Banking System is a command line banking application built in Python as part of a team project for CSCI 3060U. It recreates a simplified banking environment with separate front end and back end components, supporting user transactions, file input and output, and automated testing using shell scripts. My main contributions were creating input, output files and developing the front end.

The CLI Banking System is a command line banking application developed in Python as part of a team project for CSCI 3060U. It simulates a simplified banking environment with modular front end and back end components, supporting user transactions, file-based input and output, and automated testing through shell scripts. My primary contributions included developing the front end and preparing the necessary input and output files, with additional support provided in back end development and testing automation.
